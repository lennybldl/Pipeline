# PIPELINE

Pipeline is a python based tool made to manage, keep track, manipulate and
perform actions on files.

## The API

The API uses camel case prefixed names to separate the api attributes from the rest of the tool.  
None of those should be overriden.

1. The "p_" stands for "Pipeline". Those are attributes from the pipeline.
2. The "pfn_" stands for "Pipeline Funtion". Those are speific to api objects.
